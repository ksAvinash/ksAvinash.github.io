# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free community.
Be kind, assume good intent, and keep discussions constructive and on-topic.
Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, hate speech, threats, or sharing private information.
Project maintainers may remove content or contributions that violate this policy.
Report issues privately to the maintainers for review and appropriate action.
This applies in all project spaces and any official community channels.
